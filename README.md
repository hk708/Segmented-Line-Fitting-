# Segmented-Line-Fitting-
### :busts_in_silhouette: The Team
* Varun Naryanan
* Anish Sai Mitta
* Himnish Kapoor
* Anurag Sidharth Aribandi

### :key: Run the Project
* Compile the C++ code normally
* Running it will prompt you to enter the number of points N, followed by the N points, followed by the cost of creating a new line segment
* The output files generated must be kept in the same folder as the visualisation notebook, which can be run after the C++ code is run to visualize the result.
* The Test folder has a script C++ code that has to be in the same folder as the tetlib.h file. It takes the number of points, and the number of segments the points should roughly lie on as input. It generates a txt file with the test case. 
* The Documentation folder has the analysis HTML pages.

  
### :books: Libraries Used
* matplotlib for visualisation

### :star: Output
* The output is the line segment equations with start and end points and its error
* Two txt files are generated. One with the input points and one with the start and end point for each segment to be used for the visualization.
* The visualization notebook can be run to see the graph of the most recent test case.
